# MagiClient
Contains a collection of some of the client scripts that are used in the game I am creating

## Player GUI Handler
This script handles all of the work that is going on in the player's GUI. 

## StarterPlayerScripts
Parented to the player upon join
### EnvironmentHandler
When a player traverses the map, new environments will appear and they will venture through them. These different environments need a different ambience, fog color, and color correction than the previous. This script handles all of it.

## StarterCharacterScripts
Parented to the player's character every time they spawn
